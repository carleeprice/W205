1. List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for 
	a) Hive = 121.297s
	b) SparkSQL = 29.389s
	c) SparkSQL on Parquet = 8.897s

2. a) How many jobs does Hive launch? TWO
   b) Does SparkSQL launch jobs?  NO

3. a) Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. The was the closest I came to something that might work.  It sadly did not, and I ran out of time.

	SELECT user_id, COUNT(user_id) AS log_count
	FROM weblogs_parquet GROUP BY user_id
	ORDER BY log_count DESC
	LIMIT 5
	INNER JOIN user_info
	ON weblogs_parquet.user_id=user_info.user_id;

List the locations.

I don't have the locations but I have the top 5 user_ids from the previous query.  Would then search the user_info table for each of these IDs and pull the associated location.
