5. Discover how the Avengers grew over time from 5 to 10. Find team members starting with 5 and incrementing to 10. Who was added to the team? Is the resulting graph ever not fully connected?

The original five avengers (via Wikipedia) were: 

Hank Pym (Ant-Man), the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and the Wasp. 

However, the HULK III/BRUCE BANNE relationship was problematic.  He does not appear in this database with many of the other characters, so was replaced with Captain America (the sixth member added, per Wikipedia).

Searching on relationships between pairs of individuals in this list of five yielded a list of the 10 most common Avengers (so the longest relationships).  They are:

ANT-MAN/DR. HENRY J.  
THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK
IRON MAN/TONY STARK
WASP/JANET VAN DYNE
CAPTAIN AMERICA

HAWK
VISION
WONDER MAN/SIMON WIL
SCARLET WITCH/WANDA
SHE-HULK/JENNIFER WA

Other names appeared in the list but were problematic:
JARVIS, EDWIN who is not actualy an avenger but rather a butler to the gang.

The final visualization the relationship between one of the first (CAPTAIN AMERICA) and the 11th Avenger (TIGRA/GREER NELSON) and shows the list above.

MATCH (capn:Hero {name:'CAPTAIN AMERICA'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (tigra:Hero {name:'TIGRA/GREER NELSON'}) RETURN other ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC LIMIT 11
